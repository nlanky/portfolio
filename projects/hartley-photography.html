          <p>Hartley Photography is a photography business based in Plymouth. This project presented a new challenge as the client had an existing portfolio of photos hosted with Zenfolio (hosting platform for photographers). I attempted to market the existing website hosted on Zenfolio but was severely limited by the options on the platform - I was unable to design a custom layout for the home page for example. After a small amount of progress from the initial marketing, we decided to create a new website and link back to the galleries through the navigation menu.</p>
          <p>The new site is built in WordPress and features much more content on the services offered while maintaining a focus on images. I adapted some existing HTML & CSS to create a photo frame design to go around the services on the home page. The website also retains a modern grey theme. The client was very happy with the results and the website is now featured on page one in Google for their main keywords.</p>
