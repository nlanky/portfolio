          <p>KBB Kitchens is a Plymouth company offering kitchen design and installation. They approached us to rebuild not only the KBB Kitchens site but also their KBB Developments site (parent group) and KBB Extensions site (another of their companies). The existing sites were dated and needed updating while maintaining their ranking in Google. This was a big challenge due to the importance of keeping Google traffic and increasing conversions. The client also wanted to have a consistent colour scheme and design on the three sites while making them unique.</p>
          <p>The new sites were all built in WordPress but KBB Kitchens was the flagship and required the most work. In terms of conversions, the focus was on getting visitors to fill out the quote form. We achieved this by making the menu link stand out and having the form in the footer as well as on the home page. The purpose of the rest of the content was to ensure visitors understood KBB Kitchens provided a quality service. The website features a lot of custom CSS to achieve the design the client was looking for.</p>
